# MySQL related files

This folder contains MySQL related files, such as for instance the _"magic.sql"_
file that creates your Magic database during installation unless it already exists.

The migrations folder contains Magic migration scripts, to easily allow you to upgrade Magic,
while making sure you upgrade your database at the same time without pain.

The templates folder contains MySQL example scripts, which you can edit as you see fit
from your SQL menu item, by loading and saving scripts frequently used.
