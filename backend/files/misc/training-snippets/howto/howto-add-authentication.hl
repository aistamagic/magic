// How to add authentication?

/*
 * Adding authentication requirements to an endpoint, without requiring the
 * user belongs to a particular role, can be done using the [auth.ticket.verify]
 * slot without a list of roles. This allows any authenticated user to invoke
 * your endpoint, but does not require the user to belong to any particular role.

// Verifying user is authenticated.
