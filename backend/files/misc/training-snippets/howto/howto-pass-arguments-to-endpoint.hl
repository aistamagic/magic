// How to pass arguments to endpoint?

/*
 * How arguments are passed to an endpoint depends upon what HTTP verb
 * your endpoint is. For a GET or DELETE endpoint, arguments are passed
 * in as HTTP QUERY parameters, for instance '/foo/bar?howdy=world'.
 *
 * For POST, PUT and PATCH endpoints arguments are typically passed in
 * as a JSON payload. However, from your Hyperlambda code's point of view,
 * the code to handle arguments inside your endpoint is the exact same,
 * except GET and DELETE endpoints don't allow for passing in graph objects,
 * only simple key/value type of arguments.
 *
 * Below is an endpoint that expects email and name arguments, where both
 * arguments are mandatory, and validated such that [email] must be
 * a valid email address and [name] must be at least 5 characters in length.
 *
 * If either [name] or [email] is not given, or [email] is not a valid
 * email address, or [name] is not at least 5 characters long, the
 * Hyperlambda below will throw an exception, returning to the client which
 * argument was in violation of what rule.
