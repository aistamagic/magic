    Limassol, Cyprus, and a customer (“Customer”) to whom Aista provides cloud-based infrastructure and software

    Customer suspects that an unauthorised third party is using, or may have access to, the Service or
    the Customer's service account.
  </p>

  <h3>Third-party software</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer must comply with third-party software license terms if the use of such software is

    the Customer, with Aista's separate instructions.
  </p>

  <h3>Paid subscriptions and free trials</h3>
  <p>
    The Service and the prices for the Service (“Service Fee”) are described in the service descriptions available on
    Aista's website. Aista may from time to time offer trials of the Service for a specified period without payment.
    Aista reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine Customer's eligibility for a free trial and, subject
    to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify an offer trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability,
    to the greatest extent permitted under the law. For a free trial of the Service, Aista may require Customer to
    provide payment details to start the trial. At the end of such trial, Aista may automatically start to charge the
    applicable service fees for the Service immediately after the end of the free trial in accordance with Section
    Payment Terms and according to the price list on Aista's website. The applicable subscription to the Service must be
    cancelled through Customer's account's subscription page, or the Service must be terminated in its entirety, before
    the end of the trial period in case Customer does not accept the applicable prices provided on Aista's website.
    Customer shall ensure that the authorised Users use the Service in compliance with this Agreement. Misuse of the
    Service by Customer or any User may lead to termination of the Agreement or suspension or denial of access to the
    Service.
  </p>

  <h3>Right to use the Service and eligibility</h3>
  <p>
    Subject to due subscription to the Service and compliance with the Agreement, Aista grants to Customer a
    non-exclusive, nontransferable and limited right to enter and use the Service and grant Users access rights to the
    Service.
  </p>

  <h3>External Back-Up Copies</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer is responsible for making appropriate back-up copies of the Customer Data (as defined below) stored in
    the Service. Such back-up copies shall be stored outside the Service.
  </p>

  <h3>Changes to the Service</h3>
  <p>
    Aista is entitled to develop its services and business offerings. In case of a change in the Service, Aista will
    notify the Customer in advance. If Aista considers that a change will have a material effect in the Service, Aista
    will notify the Customer at least 30 days before the change will be effected and reserve the Customer a possibility
    to terminate the Agreement.
  </p>

    Customer in advance for each calendar month of the Service according to Aista's price list which is

    will be added to the prices unless the prices are specified VAT inclusive.
  </p>

  <h3>Payment terms</h3>
  <p>
    Aista shall charge for the Service on a monthly subscription based model, where the payment method associated with
    the subscription becomes automatically deducted in advance for one month at the time. Invoices are made available
    on the Customer's service account. To avoid being continously billed for any Service, it is the Customer's
    responsibility to delete and destroy any services the Customer no longer wants to be billed for.
  </p>

  <h3>Customer's obligations and rights</h3>
  <p>
    When subscribing to the Service, Customer shall provide true, accurate and complete information as prompted by the
    Order and update such information when required. Please note that this Agreement only covers the Service and the use
    thereof and any and all linked third party services and platforms are provided by the relevant third parties and
    covered by their terms of service or other agreement or license. Aista does not assume any liability in regard to
    use of such third-party services and platforms, whether or not they are linked to the Service.

    Customer data shall mean all Customer's data that a Customer or another party acting on Customer's behalf generates
    in or submits to the Service (“Customer Data”) or the data Customer submits to a third-party service or platform
    which might be accessed by the Service, subject to and on the basis of the permissions or consents Customer has
    granted. Customer agrees that Aista does not assume any liability or responsibility in respect to any Customer Data,
    with the exceptions relating to Personal Data as set forth in Section Data Processing below. Customer shall at all
    times ensure that Customer Data does not infringe any third party intellectual property rights or violate any
    applicable laws or legislation. Customer shall not upload any illegal, offensive, threatening, libellous,
    defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate data to the Service. For clarity, Aista is not responsible and shall not be
    held liable for any Customer Data, nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any Customer Data. Aside from the
    rights specifically granted herein, Customer retains ownership of all rights, including intellectual property
    rights, in the Customer Data.
  </p>

  <h3>Data processing</h3>
  <p>
    In order to provide the Service, Aista may process personal data on behalf of the Customer as a data processor for
    the purposes of providing the Service. Aista processes certain personal data also as a data controller. Such
    personal data includes, inter alia, data of the Customer's contact persons, invoicing details and other personal
    data of Customer's contact persons which Aista processes in order to maintain the customer relationship. The
    requirements relating to the personal data Aista processes as data controller are set out in our Privacy Policy
    available on Aista's website. In this section, “Personal Data” refers to any information relating to an identified
    or identifiable natural person the Customer enters into the Service and Aista processes on behalf of the Customer in
    the course and within the scope of providing the Services. In connection with the use of the Service, the Customer
    may transfer various data to Aista for processing on behalf of the Customer. Such data might include Personal Data.
    The Customer shall be considered as the sole data controller and Aista as the sole data processor with respect to
    such data. The following terms and conditions set forth in this section concern the data processing activities of
    Aista as a data processor with respect to the Personal Data it processes on behalf of the Customer.
  </p>

  <h3>General requirements relating to processing of Personal Data</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer shall be responsible for the lawful collection, processing and use, and for the accuracy of the
    Personal Data, as well as for preserving the rights of the individuals concerned. If and to the extent legally
    required, the Customer shall inform the individuals concerned regarding the processing of their Personal Data by
    Aista, and shall obtain their consent if necessary. The Personal Data processed by Aista on behalf of the Customer
    may include e.g. Personal Data of the Customer's employees and end-customers, such as contact details of the
    aforementioned data subjects. The Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of the Service, Aista cannot control
    and has no obligation to verify Personal Data the Customer transfers to Aista for processing on behalf of the
    Customer when the Customer uses the Service. The Customer ensures that the Customer is entitled to transfer the
    Personal Data to Aista so that Aista may lawfully process the Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in accordance
    with this Agreement. Aista shall not use Personal Data for any purpose other than that of rendering and providing
    the Service and will not assert liens or other rights over, or sell or disclose the Personal Data to any third
    parties, without the Customer's prior written approval. Aista shall process Personal Data in accordance with this
    Agreement and documented instructions from the Customer. The Customer's instructions must be commercially
    reasonable, compliant with applicable data protection laws and consistent with this Agreement. Aista shall not be
    obliged to verify whether any instructions given by the Customer are consistent with applicable laws, as the
    Customer is responsible for such compliance verification of its instructions. However, if Aista detects that any
    instruction given by the Customer is noncompliant with the requirements of any data protection legislation
    applicable to Aista's operations, Aista shall inform the Customer in writing. Aista and the Customer shall comply
    with the EU Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data
    and on the free movement of such data (“Regulation”) and any applicable European or foreign data protection laws as
    amended, as well as data protection authorities' orders and guidelines. Aista and the Customer shall implement and
    maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect the Personal Data within their area
    of responsibility, in order to safeguard the Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing or access and
    against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Such measures include where necessary and appropriate, taking into
    account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing
    as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons the following
    measures:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      access right controls to systems containing Personal Data;
    </li>
    <li>
      the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;
    </li>
    <li>
      the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems
      and services;
    </li>
    <li>
      the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a
      physical or technical incident;
    </li>
    <li>
      a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational
      measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Aista's assistance obligations</h3>
  <p>
    To respond to requests from individuals exercising their rights as foreseen in applicable data protection law, such
    as the right of access and the right to rectification or erasure, the Customer shall primarily use the corresponding
    functions of the Services, such as the Aista HUB. Aista shall provide the Customer with commercially reasonable
    assistance, without undue delay, taking into account the nature of the processing. Aista shall further provide the
    Customer with commercially reasonable assistance in ensuring compliance with the Customer's obligations to perform
    security and data protection assessments, breach notifications and prior consultations of the competent supervisory
    authority, as set out in the applicable data protection law, taking into account the nature of the processing and
    the information available to Aista. In case such assistance requires extensive measures from Aista, the Customer
    shall pay additional reasonable remuneration to Aista for handling such assistance requests. In addition, Aista
    shall, and shall procure that its personnel (including its subcontractors' personnel) shall:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      only process Personal Data in accordance with the Customer's written instructions and not for Aista’s own
      purposes;
    </li>
    <li>
      ensure that individuals processing Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an
      appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer accepts that Aista may have Personal Data processed and accessible by its subprocessors outside the
    Customer's country of domicile to provide the Service. In case the processing is subject to any EU data protection
    law and Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a subprocessor for processing in any
    country outside the EEA that is not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of
    protection for personal data, Aista provides for appropriate safeguards by standard contractual clauses, adopted or
    approved by the European Commission and applicable to the processing by the nonEEA subprocessor or by any other
    appropriate safeguard as foreseen under Regulation.
  </p>

  <h3>Audits</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer shall have the right to audit the facilities and processing activities of Aista under this Agreement
    to examine the level of protection and security provided for Personal Data processed under this Agreement and to
    assess the compliance of Aista with the terms and conditions relating to Personal Data set out herein. Each Party
    shall bear its own costs for any such audit. Where an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets
    of Aista or threaten intellectual property rights of Aista, the Customer shall employ an independent expert to carry
    out the audit, and the expert shall agree to be bound to confidentiality to Aista's benefit.
  </p>

  <h3>Subprocessors</h3>
  <p>
    General authorisation. The Customer gives its general authorisation to allow Aista to involve Aista’s affiliated
    companies and other subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the
    Service, to the extent such appointment does not lead to noncompliance with any applicable law or Aista’s
    obligations under this Agreement. Aista ensures that the involved subprocessors are properly qualified, will be
    under a data processing agreement with Aista, and comply with data processing obligations similar to the ones which
    apply to Aista under this Agreement. Aista shall be liable towards the Customer for the processing of Personal Data
    carried out by Aista's subprocessors.
  </p>

  <h3>Change of subprocessor</h3>
  <p>
    Aista is free to choose and change its subprocessors. Upon request, Aista shall inform the
    Customer of subprocessors currently involved. In case there is a later change of subprocessor
    (addition or replacement), Aista shall notify the Customer of such change. In case the Customer
    objects such change of subprocessor on reasonable grounds, the Customer has the right to
    request change of the subprocessor. If Aista is not willing to change the subprocessor the
    Customer has objected, the Customer shall have the right to terminate the Service and this
    Agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Breaches</h3>
  <p>
    Aista shall, without undue delay after having become aware of it, inform the Customer in writing about any data
    breaches relating to Personal Data and any other events where the security of Personal Data processed on behalf of
    the Customer has been compromised. Aista's notification about the breach to the Customer shall include at least the
    following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      description of the nature of the breach;
    </li>
    <li>
      name and contact details of Aista's contact point where more information can be obtained;
    </li>
    <li>
      description of the measures taken by Aista to address the breach, including, where appropriate, measures to
      mitigate its possible adverse effects.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Deletion and return of Personal Data</h3>
  <p>
    Aista shall not take any action to intentionally erase any Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer,
    without the Customer's explicit request. Personal Data shall be processed under this Agreement until the Customer
    has ceased to use the Service. Within a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of this Agreement, or after
    the Customer has permanently ceased to use the Service, Aista shall permanently delete Personal Data from its
    storage media, except to the extent that Aista is under a statutory obligation to continue storing such Personal
    Data. On the Customer's request, Aista shall confirm the deletion in writing. The obligation to delete Personal Data
    shall not apply to Personal Data contained in regular back-up copies of comprehensive datasets from which the
    individual deletion of Personal Data would not be possible without significant efforts or costs.
  </p>

  <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
  <p>
    All intellectual property rights to and in the Service as well as intellectual property rights pertaining thereto,
    are exclusive property of Aista or its licensors with all rights reserved. All intellectual property rights to the
    content uploaded into the Service by or on behalf of the Customer will remain the exclusive property of the Customer
    or its licensors. All
    intellectual property rights relating to the provision of the Services, including suggestions for improvements made
    by the Customer, will remain the exclusive property of Aista or its licensors.
  </p>

  <h3>Limited Warranty</h3>
  <p>
    Aista will offer service level compensations to the Customer in accordance with the SLA. In all other respects the
    Service is provided on “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and Aista will not give the Customer any warranty or
    guarantee, express or implied, for the Service, including but without limitation to warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for any particular purpose, performance, or noninfringement. The parties expressly note that the Service is
    not designed to be error-free or uninterrupted and therefore they are neither intended nor fit for purposes that
    require fail-safe performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
  <p>
    Aista will not be liable for indirect damage or consequential damages caused to the Customer. Aista's total
    aggregate liability under or in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to the aggregate Service Fee paid by
    the Customer for the Service for the last six (6) months preceding the occurrence for which damages are claimed.
    These limitations will not apply to damage caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence. In order to be valid and
    enforceable, all claims for damages must be made within 30 days from the date the damage was or should reasonably
    have been noticed by the Customer.
  </p>

  <h3>Assignment and Third-Party Benefits</h3>
  <p>
    Aista may assign the Agreement in whole or in part to another group company or in connection with the trade sale
    which includes the provision of the Service. The Customer may assign the Agreement to a third party with Aista's
    prior written consent which Aista will not unreasonably withhold. The Agreement will not create any third-party
    beneficiary rights in any third party.
  </p>

  <h3>Temporary Suspension</h3>
  <p>
    If the Customer has breached the provisions of the Agreement or Aista has justifiable reasons to believe such a
    breach exists, Aista may temporarily suspend the provision of the Service.
  </p>

  <h3>Termination for Convenience</h3>
  <p>
    The Customer may terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing 5 days written notice to Aista. Aista may
    terminate the Agreement for any reason by issuing 30 days written notice to the Customer.
  </p>

  <h3>Termination for Cause</h3>
  <p>
    Either Party may terminate the Agreement with immediate effect if the other Party has materially breached the
    provisions of the Agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Transition Service</h3>
  <p>
    Aista will provide the Customer with transition services in order to enable the Customer to transfer the Customer
    Data to another service provider. The Customer must order the transition services before the termination of the
    Agreement. The description of the transition services and applicable prices are provided on Aista's website.
  </p>

  <h3>Entire Agreement and Amendments</h3>
  <p>
    The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all previous commitments between the parties in
    respect of the provision of the Service. All amendments to the Agreement must be made in writing. Aista may modify
    this Agreement by notifying the Customer in writing, such as by e-mail or by posting a revised document version on
    Aista's website. If Aista considers that a revision will have a material effect on the Agreement, Aista will notify
    the Customer at least 30 days before the revision will be effected and reserve the Customer a possibility to
    terminate the Agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Non-Waiver</h3>
  <p>
    A failure by either Party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not be deemed to constitute a present or
    future waiver of such provision. All waivers must be made in writing.
  </p>

  <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
  <p>
    Force Majeure is an event that prevents, or makes unduly difficult, the performance of the Service or the
    fulfilment of the provisions of the Agreement, such as war, rebellion, natural catastrophe, general interruption in
    energy distribution or telecommunications, fire, strike, embargo, or another equally significant and unforeseen
    event independent of the parties. Each Party shall be entitled to suspend its duties without liability thereof in
    case of Force Majeure affecting the Party either directly or through its subcontractor.
  </p>

  <h3>Severability</h3>
  <p>
    Should any provision of the Agreement be declared unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
    provisions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Parties
    shall attempt through negotiation in good faith to replace the unenforceable provision with such provisions that
    correspond as closely as possible to the original intention of the Parties.
  </p>

  <h3>Governing Law and Arbitration</h3>
  <p>
    The Agreement will be governed by the substantive laws of the Republic of Cyprus, with the exception of any
    conflict of law
    principles. Any and all disputes, which the Parties fail to settle amicably, arising out of or relating to the
    Agreement will be finally settled by arbitration in English language.
